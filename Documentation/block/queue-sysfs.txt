Queue sysfs files 关于磁盘IO的调度算法
=================

This text file will detail the queue files that are located in the sysfs tree
for each block device. Note that stacked devices typically do not export
any settings, since their queue merely functions are a remapping target.
These files are the ones found in the /sys/block/xxx/queue/ directory.这个目录下的文件属性解释

Files denoted with a RO postfix are readonly and the RW postfix means
read-write.

hw_sector_size (RO)//硬件扇区大小
-------------------
This is the hardware sector size of the device, in bytes.

max_hw_sectors_kb (RO)//硬件支持的单次写最大的数据量
----------------------
This is the maximum number of kilobytes supported in a single data transfer.

max_sectors_kb (RW)//文件系统层面容许的单次传输的数据量
-------------------
This is the maximum number of kilobytes that the block layer will allow
for a filesystem request. Must be smaller than or equal to the maximum
size allowed by the hardware.

nomerges (RW)//是否允许在调度算法层中通过查表来合并请求
-------------
This enables the user to disable the lookup logic involved with IO
merging requests in the block layer. By default (0) all merges are
enabled. When set to 1 only simple one-hit merges will be tried. When
set to 2 no merge algorithms will be tried (including one-hit or more
complex tree/hash lookups).

nr_requests (RW)//控制可以分配多少个请求在块设备层
----------------
This controls how many requests may be allocated in the block layer for
read or write requests. Note that the total allocated number may be twice
this amount, since it applies only to reads or writes (not the accumulated
sum).

read_ahead_kb (RW)//最大的数据量在文件系统
------------------
Maximum number of kilobytes to read-ahead for filesystems on this block
device.

rq_affinity (RW)//请求的CPU的亲和性设置
----------------
If this option is '1', the block layer will migrate request completions to the
cpu "group" that originally submitted the request. For some workloads this
provides a significant reduction in CPU cycles due to caching effects.

For storage configurations that need to maximize distribution of completion
processing setting this option to '2' forces the completion to run on the
requesting cpu (bypassing the "group" aggregation logic).

scheduler (RW)//调度算法，将会显示当前的调度算法和支持的所有的调度算法，当前的用[]包含
	      //向该文件写入调度算法的名字，内核将会试图加载调度算法模块，如果系统中不存在。
--------------
When read, this file will display the current and available IO schedulers
for this block device. The currently active IO scheduler will be enclosed
in [] brackets. Writing an IO scheduler name to this file will switch
control of this block device to that new IO scheduler. Note that writing
an IO scheduler name to this file will attempt to load that IO scheduler
module, if it isn't already present in the system.
